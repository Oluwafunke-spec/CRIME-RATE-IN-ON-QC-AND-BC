**##Crime Rate Analysis in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia**
**Introduction**

This project examines and contrasts the rate of assault crime in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia over the last ten years. The aim is to understand the trends and patterns of assault crimes in these provinces. Microsoft Power BI was utilized to generate visualizations, facilitating easier comparison and exploration of the data. The visualizations aided in comparing crime rates between provinces, identifying top cities with high assault rates, evaluating the relationship between youth and adult crime, and forecasting assault crime rates for the following year.
Justification for the Visualization Tool

Microsoft Power BI was chosen as the visualization tool due to its user-friendly interface, interactive visualizations, and drag-and-drop capabilities. It offers effective dashboard and report sharing and interacts with numerous data sources, allowing for comprehensive analysis of crime statistics across provinces.
Explanation of Data Analysis/Visualization Approach

The data was transformed and cleaned using Power Query to prepare it for analysis. Visualizations were then created using various chart types such as bar charts, scatter plots, and maps. These visualizations were used to compare crime rates between provinces, identify top cities with high crime rates, examine correlations between youth and adult crime, and predict crime rates for the upcoming year.
Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis using Microsoft Power BI provided valuable insights into assault crime rates in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. Comparisons between provinces, identification of top cities with high crime rates, examination of correlations between youth and adult crime, and predictions for the upcoming year were conducted. The forecast indicates a potential increase in crime rate for Ontario and slight decreases for British Columbia and Quebec. Strategies such as enforcing strict laws and organizing seminars can help address the issue of crime. These findings can assist law enforcement agencies in formulating targeted strategies to improve safety and security across provinces, ultimately contributing to a safer Canada.
